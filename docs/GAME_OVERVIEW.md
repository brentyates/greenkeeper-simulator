# Greenkeeper Simulator - Game Overview

## Core Philosophy

**"From pushing a mower to running a resort."**

Greenkeeper Simulator is a first-person management game where you begin as a hands-on course greenkeeper and grow into a golf resort tycoon. Unlike god-game management sims, you start at ground level - literally mowing grass yourself - and progressively delegate responsibilities as your operation scales.

## The Greenkeeper's Journey

### Stage 1: The Solo Greenkeeper
*"It's just you, a mower, and a dream."*

You start as the head (and only) greenkeeper of a small course. Every task is done by your own hands:
- Push the mower across fairways
- Drag the sprinkler to dry patches
- Spread fertilizer where it's needed

**Why it works:**
- Your character is **faster and more efficient** than any employee you'll hire
- You learn every inch of the course intimately
- You understand what each job requires before delegating it

**The limitation:**
- A single person can't maintain a full course
- As the course grows, so does the maintenance burden
- The repetitive work becomes tedious

### Stage 2: First Employees
*"Help arrives, but you're still in the weeds."*

You hire your first groundskeepers. Now the dynamic shifts:
- Assign employees to areas or tasks
- They work while you work - parallel progress
- But they're slower and less skilled than you
- You still jump in for critical areas (greens, tournament prep)

**The tradeoff:**
- Employees cost money (wages eat into profits)
- They're less efficient (novice skill levels)
- But they scale your capability
- You're still the most valuable worker on the course

### Stage 3: The Working Manager
*"You're everywhere at once, putting out fires."*

Your course is growing. You have a small team:
- Multiple groundskeepers handling different areas
- A mechanic keeping equipment running
- Maybe an irrigator managing water systems

**Your role evolves:**
- Train and supervise employees
- Handle the critical jobs yourself (greens, problem areas)
- Step in when someone calls in sick or equipment breaks
- Start thinking about efficiency and coverage

**The tension:**
- You're still the best at every job
- But your time is increasingly valuable
- Administrative tasks compete with hands-on work

### Stage 4: The Course Superintendent
*"The course runs, but you're watching everything."*

You've built a competent team:
- Experienced employees who know their jobs
- Specialists handling specific systems
- A manager or two boosting efficiency

**Your role shifts:**
- Morning walk-through inspection
- Prioritize problem areas for crews
- Occasional hands-on intervention for quality
- Focus on standards and consistency

**The satisfaction:**
- Watch your well-oiled machine operate
- Step in occasionally just because you enjoy it
- Pride in the course you've built

### Stage 5: The Resort Director
*"You're building an empire now."*

Multiple courses, tournament hosting, five-star prestige:
- Department heads run day-to-day operations
- You focus on strategy and growth
- Facility expansion, research investment, tournament bids

**Your role becomes:**
- High-level decision making
- Resource allocation across departments
- Reputation and prestige management
- Special event oversight (tournaments, VIPs)

**The culmination:**
- Host a major championship
- Operate a world-renowned resort
- Step onto the course occasionally, just to remember where you started

## Core Design Principles

### 1. First-Person Perspective

Unlike RollerCoaster Tycoon's god-view, you experience the course at ground level:
- Walk the fairways yourself
- See the grass quality up close
- Feel the scale of the maintenance challenge
- Personal connection to your creation

**Camera options:**
- Third-person follow (default)
- First-person view (immersive)
- Overview mode (for planning, unlocked later)

### 2. Player Character Advantages

Your character is always the best worker on the course:

| Attribute | Player | Novice Employee | Expert Employee |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Movement Speed | 1.5x | 0.7x | 1.0x |
| Work Efficiency | 1.5x | 0.5x | 1.0x |
| Quality | 1.2x | 0.7x | 1.0x |
| Availability | Manual | 8-hour shifts | 8-hour shifts |

**Why this matters:**
- Doing it yourself is always faster (per task)
- But you can only be in one place at a time
- Employees multiply your presence
- The math favors delegation at scale

### 3. Natural Delegation Pressure

The game naturally pushes you toward delegation:

**Course growth:**
- Starter course: 3 holes, ~500 tiles (manageable solo)
- Standard course: 9 holes, ~1500 tiles (needs 2-3 crew)
- Championship course: 18 holes, ~3000 tiles (needs 6-10 crew)
- Resort complex: 27+ holes (department structure)

**Time pressure:**
- Grass grows continuously
- Golfers arrive on schedule
- Tournaments have preparation deadlines
- Weather events require rapid response

**Quality expectations:**
- Higher prestige requires better maintenance
- Golfer satisfaction affects revenue
- Tournament hosting demands perfection

### 4. Hands-On Always Available

Even at the highest level, you can always step in:
- Pick up a mower and cut the 18th green before the tournament
- Help the irrigation team during a drought emergency
- Personally inspect every bunker before a major event

**This creates moments:**
- Nostalgia for the early days
- Crisis intervention satisfaction
- Connection to your roots
- "Still got it" gameplay

### 5. Progressive Complexity

Systems unlock as you grow:

| Stage | Unlocked Systems |
|-------|-----------------|
| Solo | Basic equipment, core maintenance |
| First Hire | Employee management, scheduling |
| Growing Team | Training, specialization, areas |
| Superintendent | Research, upgrades, automation |
| Director | Tournaments, multi-course, prestige |

## Key Moments

### "I Need Help" Moment
The player realizes they physically cannot maintain course quality alone:
- Grass growing faster than they can mow
- Fairways browning while they water greens
- Golfer complaints about conditions

*This triggers first hire consideration.*

### "They're Not As Good" Moment
The player sees employee work quality lag behind their own:
- Missed spots, slower progress
- The temptation to do it yourself
- Learning to accept "good enough"

*This teaches delegation tolerance.*

### "It's Running Itself" Moment
The player watches the course operate smoothly without intervention:
- Morning inspection shows everything green
- Employees handling their areas
- Time to think about what's next

*This rewards good management.*

### "Bigger Dreams" Moment
The player realizes the current course is mastered:
- Five-star prestige achieved
- Staff is expert-level
- Systems are optimized

*This triggers expansion/tournament ambitions.*
